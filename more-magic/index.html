<h2>Basic Movement Prototype (for The 1st Anniversary)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The gameplay is mostly based upon classic Zelda games, but I believe the premise and execution will inject some unique identity.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Movement should feel fluid, responsive and intuitive, which I believe it is now. I'm also happy with the collisions.
I still need to implement and test the combat, though-- that's the next core feature.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Working on this was a reminder of just how unfamiliar I still am with Phaser. But I'm slowly getting the hang of it enough to
implement my ideas into the game relatively quickly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The sky background was provided in the Phaser examples. The music is "Spirit of the Girl" by Kevin MacLeod, and is free to use.
Everything else in this prototype is custom-made by me.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
One of the classic Zelda games. At least... it will be like that.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A short, 2D action/adventure game strongly inspired by The Legend of Zelda.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The Storymatic theme for this is Anniversary. Or, would have been, but we're not technically using those this time around.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Well, there will be multiple locations... but there aren't just yet. The enemy AI will introduce one of the only elements of randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To test the basic mechanics and make sure they are working well, before expanding the scope.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to think, "Wow! This is going to become a really good game!"
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
You can move around, get stopped by walls, and collect a flower.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try moving to where the flower is!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're trying to gather some flowers for your beloved, but monsters are impeding you. It's the 1st anniversary.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
For this? Like a minute, probably.
</li>

</ul>
