<h2>Untitled Spooky Game</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Game Description:</strong><br>
You are a simple smiley face... and you have found yourself in a spooky predicament! <br>
Hostile ghosts, and floating swarms of eyeballs, are menacing you. <br>
Your only hope is to collect the mystical Glowy Things to neutralize their power!! <br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>My Development Objectives:</strong><br>
1. Working gameplay, in which there are three Glowy Things to collect in order to Win The Game, 
but if you get hit by enemies three times, you will Lose The Game. (done!) <br>

2. Flocking, as demonstrated by the Eyeball enemies (done!) <br>

3. Behavior Trees, as demonstrated by the Ghost enemies (done!) <br>

4. Perlin Noise, as seen in the background (done, but mainly all borrowed from provided code.) <br>

5. Sound effects and music included (after the presentation, but... done!! :D) <br>
    
6. Make and provide a video demonstrating your results (done and done!) <br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
One of the classic Zelda games, especially the ones for Game Boy. This demo is reminiscent of an early stage, where the hero
has not acquired the sword they can use to fight back.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A short, 2D action/adventure game strongly inspired by the original The Legend of Zelda for NES, and the series's Game Boy incarnations.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Video Demonstration:</strong><br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjloI_09qis" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Well, there will be multiple locations... but there aren't just yet. The enemy AI will introduce one of the only elements of randomness.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To test the basic mechanics and make sure they are working well, before expanding the scope.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to think, "Wow! This is going to become a really good game!"
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Your goal is to acquire the flower, but you need to get past the spooky ghosts to do so. I recommend not touching them, as they will hurt you.
However, there is an item that will help you recover some health.
Also, fun bonus: after you beat the game, the ghosts can no longer hurt you. Try touching them and see what happens!
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try moving to where the flower is! Also, some of the tiles are solid walls, but it won't be immediately apparent until you touch them.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're trying to gather some flowers for your beloved, but monsters are impeding you. It's the 1st anniversary. Will you make it?
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone!
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
For this? Like a couple of minutes, probably.
</li>

</ul>
