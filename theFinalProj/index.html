<h2>Untitled Spooky Game</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Game Description:</strong><br>
<br>
You are a simple smiley face... and you have found yourself in a spooky predicament! <br>
Hostile ghosts, and floating swarms of eyeballs, are menacing you. <br>
Your only hope is to collect the mystical Glowy Things to neutralize their power!! <br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>My Development Objectives:</strong><br>
<br>
1. Working gameplay, in which there are three Glowy Things to collect in order to Win The Game, 
but if you get hit by enemies three times, you will Lose The Game. (done!) <br>

2. Flocking, as demonstrated by the Eyeball enemies (done!) <br>

3. Behavior Trees, as demonstrated by the Ghost enemies (done!) <br>

4. Perlin Noise, as seen in the background (done, but mainly all borrowed from provided code.) <br>

5. Sound effects and music included (after the in-class presentation, but... done!! :D) <br>
    
6. Make and provide a video demonstrating your results (done and done!) <br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Video Demonstration:</strong><br>
<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjloI_09qis" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Mechanical Variety:</strong><br>
<br>
The flocking behavior of the Eyeball enemies is emergent and fairly unpredictable. However, the player's movements will influence it.<br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Attributions:</strong><br>
<br>
This game was built using C++ and SDL libraries, with a code-base provided by the CS425 class / my professor.<br>
Some visual assets are borrowed from the provided assets, but the Smiley Face, Ghost, Eyeball, and Glowy Thing sprites are all made by me.<br>
The music and sound effects are all custom-made by me for this game, using my very own vocal cords! Because why not. =P<br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong><br>
<br>
I wanted to include enough features that it really feels like a game, and even has a nice level of challenge. It may be rough around the edges, <br>
but I think it turned out pretty much just as I had hoped!<br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Tips:</strong><br>
<br>
The Eyeballs aren't too much of a threat if you give them a wide berth. Watch out for the Ghosts, though-- if you get close, they're merciless!!<br>
If you get all three Glowy Things fairly quickly, you can usually win the game before the Eyeballs have a chance to give you a lot of trouble.<br>
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong><br>
<br>
Everyone!
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong><br>
<br>
For this? Like three minutes, probably.<br>
There isn't a whole lot of replay value, but the core mechanics could hypothetically support multiple levels in future.<br>
</li>

</ul>
