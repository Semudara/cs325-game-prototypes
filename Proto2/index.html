<h2>Gameplay Prototype for The 1st Anniversary</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The gameplay is mostly based upon classic Zelda games, but I believe the premise and execution will inject some unique identity.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Movement should feel fluid, responsive and intuitive, which I believe it is now. I'm also mostly happy with the collisions,
although they seem slightly wonky in tight corners. I have implemented (visible) HP, damage, and a basic death function.
Also, I finally learned how to use Tiled so there is now tileset usage in this game! That will also make any further development
of this project, particularly level design, considerably easier.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I'm excited to have made a breakthrough as far as using Tiled, and having a HUD. But, I'm still not entirely happy with the state of this prototype.
I would like to do more work on enemy AI, and start testing the combat system for after the player acquires the sword item.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The sky background and health kit image were provided in the Phaser examples.
The diamond sprite is modified but was based on a sprite also provided by Phaser.
The music is "Spirit of the Girl" by Kevin MacLeod, and is free to use.
Everything else in this prototype is custom-made by me.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
One of the classic Zelda games, especially the ones for Game Boy. This demo is reminiscent of an early stage, where the hero
has not acquired the sword they can use to fight back.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A short, 2D action/adventure game strongly inspired by the original The Legend of Zelda for NES, and the series's Game Boy incarnations.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The Storymatic theme for this is Anniversary. Or, would have been, but we're not technically using those this time around.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Well, there will be multiple locations... but there aren't just yet. The enemy AI will introduce one of the only elements of randomness.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To test the basic mechanics and make sure they are working well, before expanding the scope.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to think, "Wow! This is going to become a really good game!"
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Your goal is to acquire the flower, but you need to get past the spooky ghosts to do so. I recommend not touching them, as they will hurt you.
However, there is an item that will help you recover some health.
Also, fun bonus: after you beat the game, the ghosts can no longer hurt you. Try touching them and see what happens!
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try moving to where the flower is! Also, some of the tiles are solid walls, but it won't be immediately apparent until you touch them.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're trying to gather some flowers for your beloved, but monsters are impeding you. It's the 1st anniversary. Will you make it?
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone!
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
For this? Like a couple of minutes, probably.
</li>

</ul>
