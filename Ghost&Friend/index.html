<h2>Ghost & Friend</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is a co-op action/puzzle game with a ghost, and also a not-ghost!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This is the first time I've built a game where two different protagonists can be controlled simultaneously.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I'm still figuring out how, exactly, to get basic stuff to work in Phaser. Having music play was surprisingly difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made most of the assets from screatch. However, I borrowed the sky_bg from the tutorial and the music from Phaser examples.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Just, other top-down games like classic Zelda, or Pac-Man.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A ghost and their friend go on adventures together, to collect glowy things! They need to co-operate; the ghost can pass through some barriers, while only the ghost's friend can interact with levers and stuff. Together, they can do anything!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
No randomness; just bird's-eye movement and interaction.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Co-op play.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I would like them to have fun, and to experience the friendship between a ghost and a person who is not a ghost.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
You can move Ghost with WASD, and Friend with the Arrow Keys. Move in four directions, dodge obstacles and collect glowy things!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
You gotta co-ordinate and work together. Take it easy, though, unless you're doing a speedrun!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
see High Concept
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone!!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Like, two minutes, maybe.
</li>
