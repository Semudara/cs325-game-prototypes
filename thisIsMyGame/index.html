<h2>This is my Game?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about my game? Nothing right now. Also it's not working... >_<
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about my game technology? Well, I can't figure out how to actually make it work.
So, that's something?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

Well, I... hope I'll learn how to get it to run. Then I can work more on the design.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
They're mostly all borrowed, from the Phaser tutorial. I edited one of the sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
I borrowed code and images and literally everything from the tutorial. I spent all this time mostly
just figuring out how to do Phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Walk left and right, jump, collect stars! DON'T TOUCH THE DIAMOND.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.

What? What is that?
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.

It's... a .... platformer?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

......platforming.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?

I want them to... be able to play it.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

You can jump! And walk. Hypothetically.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?

Seriously, DON'T TOUCH THE DIAMOND.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?

There is grass, and getting stars is good.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.

Humans, mainly!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?

Just about one minute.
</li>

</ul>
